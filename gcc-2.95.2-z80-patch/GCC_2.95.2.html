<H1 align=center>GCC 2.95.2</H1>
<P>October 27, 1999 
<P>The GNU project and the GCC developers are pleased to announce the release of 
GCC version 2.95.2. GCC used to stand for the GNU C Compiler, but since the 
compiler supports several other languages aside from C, it now stands for the 
GNU Compiler Collection. 
<P>This is a minor release to address several bugs in the GCC version 2.95.1 
release. 
<P>The -fstrict-aliasing is not enabled by default for GCC 2.95.2. While the 
optimizations performed by -fstrict-aliasing are valid according to the C and 
C++ standards, the optimization have caused some problems, particularly with old 
non-conforming code. 
<P>The GCC developers are experimenting with ways to warn users about code which 
violates the C/C++ standards, but those warnings are not ready for widespread 
use at this time. Rather than wait for those warnings the GCC developers have 
chosen to disable -fstrict-aliasing by default for the GCC 2.95.2 release. 
<P>We <B>strongly</B> encourage developers to find and fix code which violates 
the C/C++ standards as -fstrict-aliasing may be enabled by default in future 
releases. Use the option -fstrict-aliasing to re-enable these optimizations. 
<P>
<UL>
  <LI>Generic bugfixes and improvements 
  <UL>
    <LI>Fix incorrectly optimized memory reference in global common 
    subexpression elimination (GCSE) optimization pass. 
    <LI>Fix code generation bug in regmove.c in which it could incorrectly 
    change a "const" value. 
    <LI>Fix bug in optimization of conditionals involving volatile memory 
    references. 
    <LI>Avoid over-allocation of stack space for some procedures. 
    <LI>Fixed bug in the compiler which caused incorrect optimization of an 
    obscure series of bit manipulations, shifts and arithmetic. 
    <LI>Fixed register allocator bug which caused teTeX to be mis-compiled on 
    Sparc targets. 
    <LI>Avoid incorrect optimization of degenerate case statements for certain 
    targets such as the ARM. 
    <LI>Fix out of range memory reference in the jump optimizer. 
    <LI>Avoid dereferencing null pointer in fix-header. 
    <LI>Fix test for GCC specific features so that it is possible to bootstrap 
    with gcc-2.6.2 and older versions of GCC. 
    <LI>Fix typo in scheduler which could potentially cause out of range memory 
    accesses. 
    <LI>Avoid incorrect loop reversal which caused incorrect code for certain 
    loops on PowerPC targets. 
    <LI>Avoid incorrect optimization of switch statements on certain targets 
    (for example the ARM). </LI></UL>
  <LI>Platform specific bugfixes and improvements 
  <UL>

    <LI>Fix bug in sparc block profiling.

  <LI>Language &amp; Runtime specific fixes. 
  <UL>
    <LI>Fix handling of constructor attribute in the C front-end which caused 
    problems building the Chill runtime library on some targets. 
    <LI>Fix minor problem merging type qualifiers in the C front-end. 
    <LI>Fix aliasing bug for pointers and references (C/C++). 
    <LI>Fix incorrect "non-constant initializer bug" when -traditional or 
    -fwritable-strings is enabled. 
    <LI>Fix build error for Chill front-end on SunOS. 
    <LI>Do not complain about duplicate instantiations when using -frepo (C++) 
    <LI>Fix array bounds handling in C++ front-end which caused problems with 
    dwarf debugging information in some circumstances. 
    <LI>Fix minor namespace problem. 
    <LI>Fix problem linking java programs. </LI></UL></LI></UL>
<P>The whole suite has been extensively <A 
href="http://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-2.95/regress.html">regression tested</A> and <A 
href="http://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-2.95/othertest.html">package tested</A>. It should 
be reliable and suitable for widespread use. 
<P>The GCC 2.95 release has several new optimizations, new targets, new 
languages and other new features as compared to EGCS 1.1 or GCC 2.8. See the <A 
href="http://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-2.95/features.html">new features</A> page for a 
more complete list of new features found in the GCC 2.95 releases. 
<P>The sources include installation instructions in both HTML and plaintext 
forms in the <CODE>install</CODE> directory in the distribution. However, the 
most up to date <A href="http://gcc.gnu.org/install/index.html">installation 
instructions</A> and <A 
href="http://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-2.95/buildstat.html">build/test status</A> are on 
the web pages. We will update those pages as new information becomes available. 
<P>The GCC developers would like to thank the numerous people that have 
contributed new features, test results, bugfixes, etc to GCC. This <A 
href="http://gcc.gnu.org/thanks.html">amazing group of volunteers</A> is what 
makes GCC successful. 
<P>And finally, we can't in good conscience fail to mention some <A 
href="http://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-2.95/caveats.html">caveats</A> to using GCC 2.95.2.
